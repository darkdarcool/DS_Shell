# DS_Shell

Hello and welcome to the DS_Shell(DarkScript Shell, and the name is pending). This is a shell made for darkscript, but is compiled down to a single exacutable file so you can use it as well! 

Currently it is in beta, and doesn't do much right now, but hopefully it will be able to do so many great things!

# Contributing

I ❤️ when you guys contribute, so you can do these things:

1. Leave an issue with a feature you want in here.
2. Leave a pull request with code from your feature
3. Just plain help other people when they try do things in 1 and 2!

# Installation

You can download the file called shell, and do 

``` bash
./shell
```
And then the process will start! I hope that a tutorial of features will come eventually, but for now, just try to figure your way around by looking at the code if you can understand any of it.

I hope that you have fun exploring the shell, and I'll see you next time! Bai!
