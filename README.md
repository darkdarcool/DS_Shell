# DS_Shell

Hello and welcome to the DS_Shell(DarkScript Shell, and the name is pending). This is a shell made for darkscript, but is compiled down to a single exacutable file so you can use it as well! 

Currently it is in beta, and doesn't do much right now, but hopefully it will be able to do so many great things!
